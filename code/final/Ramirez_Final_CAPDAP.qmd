# Introduction

In this document is the culmination of a data analysis project done with COVID-19 (covid) data taken from Our World in Data. The data itself is gathered from over 200 unique countries and regions across the world. During the pandemic, the data would be used to determine, simply put, how covid affects the globe. More specifically, it may be used to come up mitigation strategies for the disease itself or even to identify sociological disparities both within and across countries.

The data spans around four and a half years, starting at 1 January, 2020 and going until 4 August, 2024. In total, the data set has 429436 rows of data with 67 columns. It should also be noted that each country/region, denoted "location," has 1674 rows of data.
